Usages are documented in `dist/index` and also between the codes.

## Quick demo

Download `demo.zip` from [the latest release](https://github.com/thu-info-community/thu-info-app/releases/latest), and unzip it.

After that, install the unpacked directory `demo/` as an unpacked extension in Chrome.

> Note: you should have developer-mode enabled in Chrome.

Click on the installed extension `thu-info-lib-test` and you will see a blank page.

After that, you can open the console of Chrome Developer Tool and execute anything you want in it. The helper class is attached as `window.InfoHelper`.

Here is a typical example of what you will execute in the browser console.

```javascript
helper = new InfoHelper.InfoHelper()
helper.login({userId: "", password: ""})
```

## Playground

### Before you start

It is recommended that you have `Yarn` installed.

```shell
npm install -g yarn  # Skip this step if you have already used yarn before.
```

After that, install the dependencies that this project requires.

```shell
yarn install
```

Go on to the corresponding section depending on the JS environment you will be using.

**Note that due to various reasons, some operations might fail from time to time. Retrying might solve the problem.**

### Browsers

Run the following command.

```shell
yarn build-dist
```

You will find a bundled `index.js` generated in directory `demo/`.

Follow the steps in section [Quick demo](#Quick-demo) and play.

### Node.js

Run the following command.

```shell
yarn build
```

You can find the build output in directory `dist/`.

After that, run command

```shell
yarn demo
```

This will execute script `demo.js` at the root directory.

You can modify `demo.js` to perform more requests.

You can also run command

```shell
yarn play
```

to start an interactive JS environment (Node REPL).

A typical example of what you will execute will be

```javascript
import {InfoHelper} from "./dist";
const helper = new InfoHelper();
await helper.login({userId: "", password: ""});
```

### React Native

See [thu-info-app](https://github.com/thu-info-community/thu-info-app) for an example.

## Testing

Run `yarn test` for testing. It requires your personal credential since we don't have mocks for these APIs. To do this, you must create a `secrets.json`  under the root folder, with `userId` and `password` as keys.

It's ok if you meet `Timeout * Async callback was not invoked within the xxx-ms timeout...` error when running tests. Adjusting the third argument timeout of the failing testcase `it("xxx", async () => void, timeout)` might solve the problem.

Due to various reasons, some test cases might fail. Re-running them might solve the problem.
